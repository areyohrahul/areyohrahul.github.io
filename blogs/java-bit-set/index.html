        <p>If you've ever assumed that Java's <code>BitSet</code> is just a glorified boolean array, you're not alone. I used to think the same-until I took a peek under the hood. What I found was pretty surprising, and if you're curious too, you're in for a treat. Let's dive into why <code>BitSet</code> is way cooler than it seems to be.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What is a Java Bitset if not a boolean array?</h2>
<p>Java <code>BitSet</code> is much more than a simple <code>boolean</code> array. It uses bit manipulation on <code>long</code> data types to efficiently store and manage data. If this sounds confusing, don't worry—we'll break it down.</p>
<h3>Bit manipulation 101</h3>
<p>A <code>long</code> in Java is a 64-bit number, meaning it can store 64 individual bits. With bit manipulation, you can directly control each of these bits.</p>
<p>For example, to set a specific bit (let's say the 12th bit) in a <code>long</code> variable, you can use the OR operation. Imagine you have a 64-bit <code>long</code> variable called data, and you want to set the 12th bit to 1. You'd do something like this:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>data | 0000000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000L
</code></pre>

<p>Here, everything is 0 except the bit you want to set. As a result, only that bit gets updated, while the rest remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to check the value of the 12th bit in this variable, you'd use the AND operation:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code>data &amp; 0000000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000L
</code></pre>

<p>This will return 0 or 1, depending on whether that bit is set or not.</p>
<h3>References from Java Bitset internals</h3>
<p><code>Bitset</code> stores all the <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/jdk8u_jdk/blob/master/src/share/classes/java/util/BitSet.java#L92">data</a> in a <code>long</code> array. This continuously keeps <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/jdk8u_jdk/blob/master/src/share/classes/java/util/BitSet.java#L333C18-L333C32">changing</a> based on the data needs of the client just like most collections in Java.</p>
<p>If you want to store the 1,000th bit, you first find the right index in the array. Then, you determine which specific bit (out of the 64 in that <code>long</code>) represents the 1,000th bit. Once you've identified it, you perform the necessary bitwise operation on that bit.</p>
<h4>set()</h4>
<p>When something is required to be set in the <code>Bitset</code>, a <code>set()</code> method is invoked. This method first finds out the index of the array this bit will fall into. Then, it verifies if the array has the required <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/jdk8u_jdk/blob/master/src/share/classes/java/util/BitSet.java#L447">capacity</a> to store it. After that, it simply sets the bit using an <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/jdk8u_jdk/blob/master/src/share/classes/java/util/BitSet.java#L449">OR</a> operation that we saw above.</p>
<h4>get()</h4>
<p><code>get()</code> operation works in a similar way. We first find out the <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/jdk8u_jdk/blob/master/src/share/classes/java/util/BitSet.java#L627">index</a> of the array this bit will fall into. Then, we ensure that this position is in a <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/jdk8u_jdk/blob/master/src/share/classes/java/util/BitSet.java#L628">valid</a> range or not. If it is, then we use an <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/jdk8u_jdk/blob/master/src/share/classes/java/util/BitSet.java#L629">AND</a> operation to extract the bit value.</p>
<p><code>BitSet</code> offers many additional features, but to keep this article focused, we won't dive into all of them here. If you're curious, I encourage you to explore its full capabilities by checking out the source code—it's a fascinating read!</p>
<hr />
<h2>Ending notes</h2>
<p>Java <code>BitSet</code> is way more than just a fancy <code>boolean</code> array—it's a clever, efficient tool that makes managing bits surprisingly cool. Hopefully, this gave you a glimpse of how it works under the hood and why it's worth exploring.</p>
<p>Hope you learned something new today.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading. Happy coding!</p>
