        <p>While reading <a href="https://amzn.to/4luT4bC">Database Internals</a>, I came across an answer to a question I'd always wondered: Why does MySQL (specifically InnoDB) use B+ Trees instead of Binary Trees?</p>
<p>In this post, we'll explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>How InnoDB uses B+ Trees</li>
<li>Why binary trees don't work well for databases</li>
<li>How B+ Trees solve those problems</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's dive in.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What is a B+ Tree (quick refresher)?</h2>
<p>A B+ Tree is a self-balancing n-ary tree structure, meaning each node can have many children,  not just two, like in a binary tree.</p>
<p>Key properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal nodes store only keys.</li>
<li>Leaf nodes store the actual data (or pointers to data).</li>
<li>Leaf nodes are linked for fast range scans.</li>
<li>High fanout (hundreds of children per node) keeps the tree shallow.</li>
</ul>
<p>You could refer to the image given below to get an idea of how it looks:</p>

<hr />
<h2>How does InnoDB use B+ Trees?</h2>
<p>In InnoDB, every table is stored as a clustered B+ tree, ordered by its <strong>primary key</strong>. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>The B+ tree is sorted by the primary key column(s)</li>
<li>Each leaf node contains the full row data</li>
<li>There's no separate heap. The table is the index</li>
</ul>
<p>To fetch a row using the primary key, InnoDB walks the tree until it reaches the appropriate leaf node and retrieves the row from there.</p>
<p>Secondary indexes are also B+ Trees but store the indexed column(s) plus a pointer to the primary key. (I've written more on secondary indexes <a href="/blogs/primary-index-as-an-indirection">here</a>)</p>
<hr />
<h2>Why binary trees don't work well for InnoDB?</h2>
<p>Binary trees are great in-memory structures, but they fall short for on-disk storage for the following reasons:</p>
<h3>1. Poor data locality</h3>
<p>Each node is small and typically placed separately on disk. This means following a parent-to-child pointer may jump across multiple disk pages, causing random I/O.</p>
<h3>2. Low Fanout = Tall Trees</h3>
<p>With only two children per node, binary trees grow tall quickly. To locate a row, the database might have to read logâ‚‚(n) pages. This is not ideal when each read means a disk seek.</p>
<h3>3. Rebalancing is Costly</h3>
<p>Binary trees are more likely to become unbalanced, especially with insert-heavy workloads. To maintain balance, the tree structure must be adjusted often,  which, on disk, means reading and rewriting multiple nodes across different pages. This leads to a lot of random I/O.</p>
<hr />
<h2>How do B+ Trees solve this problem?</h2>
<p>B+ Trees were designed specifically to address the limitations of binary trees in disk-based systems. They offer several advantages that make them ideal for database indexes:</p>
<h3>1. Better Data Locality</h3>
<p>B+ Trees store multiple keys per node, and each node fits neatly into a disk page. This improves cache performance and reduces random I/O, as traversals touch fewer pages and stay within contiguous blocks more often.</p>
<h3>2. High Fanout = Shallow Trees</h3>
<p>Each node in a B+ Tree can store hundreds of keys (depending on the row and page size). This means the tree remains very shallow, even with millions of rows,  usually just 3 to 4 levels deep. Fewer levels = fewer disk reads during lookups.</p>
<h3>3. Less Frequent Rebalancing</h3>
<p>Thanks to their high fanout, B+ Trees stay balanced naturally and require far fewer restructuring operations than binary trees. This reduces the  I/O overhead.</p>
<h3>4. Efficient Range Queries</h3>
<p>Since all data is stored in the leaf nodes, and these leaves are linked like a linked list, range scans (e.g., <code>WHERE age BETWEEN 20 AND 30</code>) can be performed sequentially, without going back up the tree.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Ending notes</h2>
<p>In this article, we explored why databases like MySQL's InnoDB use B+ Trees instead of binary trees.</p>
